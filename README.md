# ANSI C. Innopolis Spring 2018

### Your First Step
This project has [wiki](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_ansic_spring/wiki).
As the course develops, useful pages will be generated there, which may be useful to you.

In particular, the wiki will help you make your first CORRECT steps in learning the C language
and [additional tools](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_ansic_spring/wiki/Toolkit) that make life easier.

Links to the course materials will appear in [README](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_ansic_spring/blob/master/README.md), so please check the current changes in this file.

The course materials themselves will be partially laid out in the current repository, or in the Google Drive folder. 
The [link to Google Drive](https://github.com/cubazis/inno_ansic_spring/blob/master/imgs/ahahah.gif) is in the Telegram channel. 
Please don't share the link to Google Drive or to Telegram Channel, because some materials are private intellectual property.
